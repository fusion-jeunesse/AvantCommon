# AvantCommon

#################################################

> **This plugin is under development. Please wait for Release 2.0.**

#################################################

This plugin supports and is required by the following plugins:
 
* [AvantAdmin](https://github.com/gsoules/AvantAdmin)
* [AvantCustom](https://github.com/gsoules/AvantCustom)
* [AvantElements](https://github.com/gsoules/AvantElements)
* [AvantRelationships](https://github.com/gsoules/AvantRelationships)
* [AvantSearch](https://github.com/gsoules/AvantSearch)
 
AvantCommon provides no functionality by itself, but does require configuration to support the plugins above
that depend on it. See the **Usage** section below to learn how to configure this plugin.

## Dependencies
AvantCommon depends on the following open source libraries which are included in the `views/shared/javascripts` folder.
Click the links below to see copyrights and licenses for each.

* [Magnific Popup](https://github.com/dimsemenov/Magnific-Popup/) - lightbox for jQuery (only a dependency when using the Lightbox
feature described below).

## Installation

1. Unzip the AvantCommon-master file into your Omeka installation's plugin directory.
1. Rename the folder to AvantCommon.
1. Activate the plugin from the Admin → Settings → Plugins page.

## Lightbox feature

The AvantCommon plugin provides support for the Lightbox feature that is used by AvantSearch and AvantRelationships
on pages that display thumbnails. When enabled, the Lightbox feature lets you click on a thumbnail to see it's
original-size image in a popup lightbox. You can then click the large image in the lightbox to see the next image on
the page (and continue clicking to see the others).

##### The Lightbox feature lets you:
* See other images on the page by:
    * Clicking on the current image to see the next image
    * Clicking the left and right arrows to see the previous or next image
* Go to the item for the image being displayed by clicking on the title link in the the bottom left corner.
If the title is the filename of an image or other file attached to the item being viewed, the title will have no hyperlink.
* Close the lightbox these three ways:
    * Click on the X in the upper right corner
    * Click anywhere on the page outside the lightbox
    * Press the Esc key

To enable the Lightbox feature, go to the AvantCommon configuration page and check the box for Enable Lightbox.
If you don't enable the Lightbox feature, clicking a thumbnail will cause the original image to open in a separate browser tab.

## Usage

AvantCommon has the following configuration options.

Option | Description
--------|------------
Identifier&nbsp;Element |  The element used to uniquely identify an Item. Often this is the Dublin Core 'Identifier' element, but if your installation uses a different element for this purpose, specify it here. For example: `Object ID`. Note that the Identifier Element is what you'll using when establishing relationships using the AvantRelationships plugin.
Identifier Alias | The element used as an alias for the item Identifier. Leave this blank if you want the Identifier Element's value to display as an item's identifier. However, if your installation uses a different element for the public facing identifier value, specify that element here. For example, if you use a `Catalogue #` element to store composite catalogue number such as `2018.123.001`, you could specify that element here. For example: `Catalogue #`
Identifier Prefix | The prefix is text that will appear before the identifier or alias. You can leave it blank or provide a value. For example: `Item` or `Catalogue #`.
Private Elements | Elements that public users should not be able to see or search. Specify each element name on its on row.
Unused&nbsp;Elements | Elements that your installation is not currently using and that should not appear on the admin Edit page. Specify each element name on its on row.
Start Year | The name of the element used to store a four digit year indicating the start of an item's date range.
End Year | The name of the element used to store a four digit year indicating the end of an item's date range.
Enable Lightbox | Check the box to display thumbnails using the Lightbox feature described above. This works with the thumbnails generated by AvantSearch and AvantRelationships. When this option is unchecked, clicking on a thumbnail displays the larger image in a separate browser tab.

##### Notes
* Start Year and End Year must both be provided or both left blank.
* The Private Elements and Unused Elements options can be used instead of or in conjunction with the
 [Hide Elements](https://github.com/zerocrates/HideElements) plugin.
